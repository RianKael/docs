+# AI Project Starter Guide for a Business Use Case
+
+This guide walks through how to structure, build, and iterate on a small AI-powered product when you are new to the field. It favors simple, reliable tools so you can ship value quickly and learn as you go.
+
+## 1) Clarify the Business Problem
+- **Write one-sentence goal** (e.g., "Automatically summarize customer support emails into action items").
+- **Define success metrics** such as response-time reduction, time saved per user, or conversion uplift.
+- **Identify constraints**: data privacy rules (GDPR/CCPA), latency needs, and budget for hosting and APIs.
+
+## 2) Collect and Organize Data
+- **Start with small, real examples** (50–200 records) that reflect the end task.
+- **Anonymize sensitive fields** before storing or sending to any model provider.
+- **Label the data**: pair inputs (emails, tickets, documents) with desired outputs (summaries, categories, answers).
+- **Store safely**: a simple CSV/JSON in a private repo or a secure database is enough for early prototypes.
+
+## 3) Choose an Initial Model Strategy
+- **API-first** for speed: use a hosted LLM (e.g., OpenAI API) to avoid managing infrastructure.
+- **Prompting over training**: craft a clear system prompt, include examples, and set boundaries (tone, style, length).
+- **Guardrails**: add instructions to decline unrelated requests and to keep outputs concise.
+
+## 4) Build a Minimal Viable Product (MVP)
+- **Backend**: a lightweight Python service (FastAPI) with a single endpoint that calls the model and returns results.
+- **Frontend** (optional): a simple form that accepts text and shows the model response.
+- **Logging**: store prompts, responses, and user feedback (thumbs up/down) to improve later.
+- **Testing**: add smoke tests for the API route and a few golden responses to catch regressions.
+
+## 5) Iterate with Prompt and Data Improvements
+- **Collect failures**: save examples where the model is wrong or unhelpful.
+- **Refine prompts**: add more examples, specify formatting, and set stricter instructions for edge cases.
+- **Use retrieval** if needed: store your domain documents (policies, product info) in a vector database and pass the top results to the model so it stays grounded.
+
+## 6) Consider Fine-Tuning (Optional)
+- **When to do it**: you see repeatable errors that prompting cannot fix, and you have 500–2,000+ high-quality pairs.
+- **How**: start with a small fine-tune on a cost-effective model; keep a held-out validation set to measure gains.
+- **Deploy**: version models and prompts; route a small percentage of traffic to new versions before full rollout.
+
+## 7) Operate Safely
+- **Content filters**: block disallowed inputs/outputs (PII leakage, unsafe requests).
+- **Rate limiting**: protect the service from abuse and control costs.
+- **Monitoring**: track latency, error rates, and user satisfaction. Alert on spikes.
+- **Compliance**: document data flows and vendor usage; provide opt-outs where required.
+
+## 8) Simple Project Roadmap
+- **Week 1**: finalize the problem statement, gather sample data, write initial prompt, and build one API endpoint.
+- **Week 2**: add feedback logging, basic frontend, and golden tests. Start collecting real user feedback.
+- **Week 3–4**: iterate on prompts, add retrieval if needed, and harden monitoring and security.
+
+## 9) Lightweight Tech Stack Recommendation
+- **Language**: Python 3.11+
+- **Backend**: FastAPI + `httpx` for API calls
+- **Model access**: Hosted LLM API (e.g., OpenAI) with API key in environment variables
+- **Retrieval (optional)**: SQLite + `chromadb` or `faiss` for small-scale vector search
+- **Testing**: `pytest` for unit tests; `ruff` for linting
+
+## 10) Next Steps for You
+- Pick one business problem and write its success metric today.
+- Gather 20–50 real examples and draft a first prompt using them.
+- Build the single-endpoint API and try it with teammates before expanding.
+
+Use this as a checklist to stay focused on delivering measurable business value, not just model experimentation.
